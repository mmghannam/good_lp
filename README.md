```rust
use std::error::Error;

use good_lp::{constraint, default_solver, Solution, SolverModel, variables};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
    variables! {
        vars:
               a <= 1;
          2 <= b <= 4;
    } // variables can also be added dynamically
    let solution = vars.maximise(10 * (a - b / 5) - b)
        .using(default_solver) // multiple solvers available
        .with(constraint!(a + 2 <= b))
        .with(constraint!(1 + a >= 4 - b))
        .solve()?;
    println!("a={}   b={}", solution.value(a), solution.value(b));
    println!("a + b = {}", solution.eval(a + b));
    Ok(())
}
```

## Features and limitations

- **Linear programming**. This crate currently supports only the definition of linear programs. You cannot use it with
  quadratic functions. For instance:
  you can maximise `3 * x + y`, but not `3 * x * y`.
- **Continuous and integer variables**. good_lp itself supports mixed integer-linear programming (MILP),
  but not all underlying solvers support integer variables.
- **Not a solver**. This crate uses other rust crates to provide the solvers.
  There is no solving algorithm in good_lp itself. If you have an issue with a solver,
  report it to the solver directly. See below for the list of supported solvers.

### Contributing

Pull requests are welcome !
If you need a feature that is not yet implemented, get in touch.
Also, do not hesitate to open issues to discuss the implementation.

### Alternatives

If you need non-linear programming, you can use
[lp-modeler](https://crates.io/crates/lp-modeler).
However, it is currently very slow with large problems.

You can also directly use the underlying solver libraries, such as
[coin_cbc](https://docs.rs/coin_cbc/) or
[minilp](https://crates.io/crates/minilp)
if you don't need a way to express your objective function and
constraints using an idiomatic rust syntax.

## Usage examples

You can find a resource allocation problem example in
[`resource_allocation_problem.rs`](https://github.com/lovasoa/good_lp/blob/main/tests/resource_allocation_problem.rs).

## Solvers

This library offers an abstraction over multiple solvers. By default, it uses [cbc][cbc], but
you can also activate other solvers using cargo features.

- \* no C compiler: builds with only cargo, without requiring you to install a C compiler
- \*\* no additional libs: works without additional libraries at runtime, all the dependencies are statically linked

To use an alternative solver, put the following in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
good_lp = { version = "*", features = ["your solver feature name"], default-features = false }
```

### [cbc][cbc]

Used by default, performant, but requires to have the cbc C library headers available on the build machine,
and the cbc dynamic library available on any machine where you want to run your program.

In ubuntu, you can install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc coinor-libcbc-dev
```

In MacOS, using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) :

```bash
brew install cbc
```

Be careful if you disable the default features of this crate and activate the cbc feature manually.
In this case, you have to also activate `singlethread-cbc`,
unless you compiled Cbc yourself with the [`CBC_THREAD_SAFE`](https://github.com/coin-or/Cbc/issues/332)
option. Otherwise, using Cbc from multiple threads would be unsafe.

### [minilp](https://docs.rs/minilp)

minilp is a pure rust solver, which means it works out of the box without installing anything else.

[minilp]: https://docs.rs/minilp

Minilp is written in pure rust, so you can use it without having to install a C compiler on your machine,
or having to install any external library, but it is slower than other solvers.

It performs very poorly when compiled in debug mode, so be sure to compile your code
in `--release` mode when solving large problems.

### [HiGHS][highs]

HiGHS is a free ([MIT](https://github.com/ERGO-Code/HiGHS/blob/master/LICENSE)) parallel mixed integer linear programming
solver written in C++.
It is able to use [OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) to fully leverage all the available processor cores
to solve a problem.

good_lp uses the [highs crate](https://docs.rs/highs) to call HiGHS.
You will need a C compiler, but you shouldn't have to install any additional library on linux
(it depends only on OpenMP and the C++ standard library).
More information in the [highs-sys crate](https://crates.io/crates/highs-sys).

[highs]: https://highs.dev

### [lpsolve][lpsolve]

lp_solve is a free ([LGPL](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/LGPL.htm)) linear (integer) programming solver
written in C and based on the revised simplex method.

good_lp uses the [lpsolve crate](https://docs.rs/lpsolve/) to call lpsolve.
You will need a C compiler, but you won't have to install any additional library.

[lpsolve]: http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/

### [lp-solvers][lps]

The `lp-solvers` feature is particular: it doesn't contain any solver.
Instead, it calls other solvers at runtime.
It writes the given problem to a `.lp` file, and launches an external solver command
(such as **gurobi**, **cplex**, **cbc**, or **glpk**) to solve it.

There is some overhead associated to this method: it can take a few hundred milliseconds
to write the problem to a file, launch the external solver, wait for it to finish, and then parse its solution.
If you are not solving a few large problems but many small ones (in a web server, for instance),
then this method may not be appropriate.

Additionally, the end user of your program will have to install the desired solver on his own.

### [SCIP][scip]

SCIP is currently one of the fastest open-source solvers for mixed integer programming (MIP) and mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). It is also a framework for constraint integer programming and branch-cut-and-price. It allows for total control of the solution process and the access of detailed information down to the guts of the solver.

`good_lp` uses SCIP through the its rust interface [russcip](https://github.com/mmghannam/russcip). To use this feature you will need to install SCIP. The easiest way to do it is to install a precompiled package from [here](https://scipopt.org/index.php#download) or through conda by running
```
conda install --channel conda-forge scip
```
